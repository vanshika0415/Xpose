# Xpose: Human Pose Estimation and Detection

This project implements a real-time human pose estimation and detection system tailored to analyze and provide accuracy metrics for specific sports poses, with a focus on golf. It leverages advanced computer vision techniques to ensure athletes receive actionable feedback to refine their performance.
## Key Features

Precision Pose Detection:
Utilizes state-of-the-art pose estimation models to accurately detect and analyze human poses, focusing on the golf swing and posture.

Real-Time Analysis:
Processes video input using OpenCV to provide immediate feedback on pose accuracy and deviations.

Pose Accuracy Metrics:
Calculates and displays accuracy scores for specific poses, comparing them against an ideal reference pose for effective coaching.

Enhanced Visualization:
Integrates cvzone to deliver intuitive and visually engaging overlays of pose lines, key points, and accuracy metrics.
## Technologies Used:

Python: Primary programming language for system implementation.

YOLO & Pose Models: Utilizes cutting-edge YOLO models integrated with pose estimation frameworks like MediaPipe or OpenPose for detecting and evaluating body movements.

OpenCV: Handles video streams and processes each frame in real time for pose analysis.

Computer Vision: Drives the detection and evaluation process to ensure precision in pose estimation.

Machine Learning: Enables comparison of detected poses with reference poses and adjusts feedback dynamically based on individual performance.
